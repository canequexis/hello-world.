This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Javier, and I’m a proud father of two amazing daughters, ages 11 and 14. Family is at the heart of everything I do. Professionally, I work as an Automation Support Engineer at a cancer hospital in the Tampa Bay area, where I’m passionate about leveraging technology to improve healthcare processes and support life-saving treatments. I enjoy solving complex problems, streamlining workflows, and contributing to a mission that truly makes a difference.
